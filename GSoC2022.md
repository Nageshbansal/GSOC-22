# Google Summer of Code 2022 Final Work Product
* **Name:** Nagesh Bansal
* **Organisation:** NumFocus
* **Sub-Organisation:** Data Retriever
* **Project:** [**neonwranglerpy**-Data retrieval using NeonVegWrangler ](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy)

## Proposed Objectives
* Querying the NEON-DATA-API
* Retrieval  of Vegetation Structure (VST) Data
* Translation VST related functions from neonVegWrangleR
* Retrieval of Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) Data
* Refactor AOP Functions from neonVegWrangleR


## Objectives Completed
 ### 1. Querying the NEON-DATA-API

The First Task of this Pipeline was to query the Neon data API to retrieve the datasets. In the NeonVegWrangleR package, We were using the [neon-utilities](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities) package, But there is no python wrapper available for this package till now, so this issue can be solved in two ways:  
- Refactoring of the neon-utilities package function   
- Usage of the R functions in Python Package with The help of the rpy2 package.  
 This pipeline proceeds with the (1) method, and functions like `loadByProduct`
,  `zipsByProduct`,  `stackByTables`,  `byTileAOP` were refactored succesfully.

> These functions are meant to download the Vegetation Structure Data and Airborne Observation Platform for now but We have been talking about making it in a way it can be generalized to the other data-products, also.

-   [_Querying the API directly without using the Neon Utilities (PR#6)_](http://Querying%20the%20API%20directly%20without%20using%20the%20Neon%20Utilities%20#6)
-   [_Functions for getting recent versions of the files(PR #14)_](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/14)
-   [_Tools Functions ( PR #13)_](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/13)

-   [_Table Types Functions (PR #16)_](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/16)*

 ### 2.  Retrieval of Vegetation Structure(VST) Data

  The Vegetation Structure Data can be retrieved by using `load_by_product()` function  or by using the `zips_by_product()` and `stack_by_table()` functions simultaneously.  Tests and docs for these functions were also added, and Tutorials for using these function were also created.
  *Pull Requests:*
-  [_Retrieve_VST_Data_](http://Querying%20the%20API%20directly%20without%20using%20the%20Neon%20Utilities%20#6)
 ### 3. Translates VST related functions from neonVegWrangleR

Refactoring of the VST Related functions from neonVegWrangleR package were done in python. The functions that were part of this was : 
`retrieve_VST_Data`,  `retrieve_coords_itc`, `retrieve_dist_to_utm`. 
These functions helps in retrieving the VST data using the `load_by_product` funtion, Adding the UTM coordinates of vst entries based on azimuth and distance and merging of  these coordinates with the `apparent_individual entries`.

  *Pull Requests:*
*  [_Translates VST related functions from neonVegWrangleR_]( https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/29)
  * [_Adds ALL_NEON_TOS_Plots_V9 data_]( https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/25)


### 4. Retrieval of Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) Data

  The Airborne Observation Platform Data can be downloaded using the `by_tile_aop()` function. I refactored the 'byTileAOP()' function along with get_tile_urls() function from the neon-utilities package. 

  *Pull Requests:*
  *  [_Retrieves AOP data_]( https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/28)

### 4. Refactor AOP Functions from neonVegWrangleR

Refactoring of the AOP Related functions from neonVegWrangleR package were done in python. The functions that were part of this was: 
* `retrieve_AOP_Data` : This function helps in retrieving the AOP data using the `by_tile_aop()` funtion for the given indivdual vegetation structure data coordinates.
* `crop_plot_data()`: This function helps create a shapefile out of vegetation structure data with lat/lon coordinates. and after that, it applies the clip_plot() function to the clip plot from AOP data using this shapefile.
* `Clip_plot` : In NeonVegWrangleR , clip_plot function clips plots around NEON VST data. it works on following types of data : 1. raster (.tif) 2. lidar point cloud (.laz) 3. Hierarchical data (.h5).

*Pull Requests:*
  *  [_retrieve_aop_data_function_]( https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/28)
  * [_crop_plot_data_](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/28)



## Other Objectives
### 1. Unit Testing of the Package
 Unit Tests of package was done by creating tests for  functions like `loadByProduct`
,  `zipsByProduct`,  `stackByTables`,  `byTileAOP`, `retrieve_aop_data`, `retrieve_vst_data` succesfully.
*Pull Requests:*
  *  [_retrieve_aop_data_function_]( https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/28)
  * [_crop_plot_data_](https://github.com/weecology/neonwranglerpy/pull/28)

### 2. Documentation
### 3. Setting up CI/CD

## Tutorials and Blogs
During the GSoC Period, my mentor Henry and Sergio Marconi motivated me to explore new Tech stacks such as apache web servers, packaging in cpp etc. and also to write blogs and tutorials explaning my work in this project.
